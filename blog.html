        <p class="">There are some difference between var, let and const. var and let are redecleareble but const is fixed. We can not change the value from a variable which is decleared by const. We will use let when we will need to change the value of a variable. And we will use const when we don't need to redecleare a value of a variable. we will not use var because it does not have much advantages.</p>

        <p class=""><span class="mb-2 block">The use cases of null and undefiend is written below:</span>
            null is used to set a value empty. It is fixed that the variable does not have any value. we use null for sometimes for difference purpose. on the other hand , when we decleare a variable but do not provide any value, it is undefiend. It is not fixed that it does not have any value. we can provide a value when it will remain undefiend.
